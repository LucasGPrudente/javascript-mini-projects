### Binary to Decimal

8-bit binary to decimal converter, it is also possible to convert decimal to binary.

There are two inputs, each with its name just above. Both inputs have restrictions:
- Binary input accepts only 0 and 1 and has a maximum length of 8.
- Decimal input accepts numbers from 0 to 9, the minimum number is 0 and the maximum is 255.

If the input restriction is broken, a warning of the limitations will be shown just below the input.
